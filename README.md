## Getting Started

To get started fork the repo

## Prerequisites

After you fork the repo, open the file.
In the terminal, bundle install for the latest updates.
If you don't have 'live server' installed, install it now so you can launch the development from your IDE.

## Deployment

Once that is done, 
In terminal, type in rails s/server 
Then launch live server from your IDE.

## Running the tests

Type in rails console/c to check your backend data
Example: Rails c enables you to look into your backend using SQLITE.
Once you are loading the development environment, you can type things like
